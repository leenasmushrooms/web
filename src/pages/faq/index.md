What is the cost of grow room 

The cost of Grow Room is Rs.250/ plus courier charges for delivery anywhere in india.

How to use Grow Room 



·         Place the bags in a well-lit area to grow, but not in direct sunlight. Light is not necessary. It is fine to leave your kit in the dark overnight.

·         Make slits in the plastic bag as depicted in the cover.

·         Temperatures of 24 - 27°C are best for oyster mushrooms. Temperatures above and below may reduce yield, change shape, colour, and increase time of appearance of mushrooms.

·         Mushrooms will sprout out of the holes in 10-15 days. Water by spray misting on the surface once a day. In this case you would be watering the plastic bag with the slits in it. When the small oyster mushrooms start sprouting, increase watering to 2-3 times a day depending on the outside humidity. Do not overwater the mushrooms as their keeping quality drastically reduces by extra water on mushrooms. Secret of good quality mushrooms is humidity (80-85%) rather than irrigation. Air circulation is necessary for normal mushroom growth. The lack of fresh air will prevent mushrooms from growing and produce long stringy mushrooms.

·         Harvesting - harvest by twisting slowly one complete turn to free them from the growing medium. Be careful not to damage the growing mediums' surface. Do not cut the mushrooms off, because this leaves a stump to rot, which can later inhibit the fruiting of the next crop. Harvest mushrooms when young and the colour starts becoming lighter. Overmature mushrooms cannot be stored.

·         Harvest the mushroom on the 3rd day after pinning. Four harvests will get from a mushroom bag at an interval of 10-20 days. This mushroom bag has a life of 4 months.
