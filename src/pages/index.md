  title: How We Can Help
  description: "Our story success is scattered with challenges that we had to face
    throughout the journey; each challenge was a new opportunity which made us
    better and stronger. Unlike other mushroom consultants, we are the only
    high-tech mushroom farm consultants who have seen the complete life cycle of
    mushroom business. We have set up our own high-tech farm, we have our own
    spawn lab, and we cultivate and market our mushrooms and that gives us the
    expertise we claim. "

  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
